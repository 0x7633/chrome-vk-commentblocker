How to use
--------------

Chrome gives you a quick way of loading up your working directory for testing:

 * Visit `chrome://extensions` in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox:  The menu's icon is three horizontal bars.. and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).
 * Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
 * Click Load unpacked extension… to pop up a file-selection dialog.
 * Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.

Alternatively, you can drag and drop the directory where your extension files live onto `chrome://extensions` in your browser to load it.
